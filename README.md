## 🚀 Usage

Mirava v3.4.1 can be used interactively or through direct CLI options. When it is started in an interactive terminal without arguments, it opens the menu automatically. In non-interactive input/output, running without arguments falls back to checking all registered mirrors.

### Recommended interactive run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiravaOrg/Mirava.git
cd Mirava
chmod +x check_mirrors.sh
./check_mirrors.sh
```

To use only the script, download it first and then execute it. This lets the portable launcher install missing bootstrap dependencies and restart itself with Bash when necessary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiravaOrg/Mirava/refs/heads/main/check_mirrors.sh -o check_mirrors.sh
chmod +x check_mirrors.sh
./check_mirrors.sh
```

### Interactive menu

| Key | Menu action | What it does |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| `1` | Optimize repository for this Linux system | Detects the distro/package manager, validates compatible repository layouts, benchmarks candidates, ranks them by measured speed and TTFB, and optionally applies the fastest compatible mirror after confirmation. |
| `2` | Find fastest repository/package mirror | Lets you choose any package/repository type from `mirrors_list.yaml`, validates and benchmarks matching mirrors, and shows a ranked result. If the selected type matches the detected system repository family, Mirava can also offer to apply it. |
| `3` | Check all registered mirrors/packages | Checks all registered mirror/package endpoints in parallel and reports reachable/unreachable results with adaptive progress output. |
| `4` | DNS benchmark & management | Opens the DNS submenu for local, global, or combined resolver benchmarks, current DNS display, optional application of the fastest pair, and reset of Mirava-managed DNS changes. |
| `5` | Show current DNS | Reads the system's currently configured DNS servers and prints them without changing anything. |
| `6` | Show server / network overview | Shows hostname, RAM/uptime, OS/architecture, public IP/location when available, current DNS, active Linux repository, and Docker package repository. |
| `7` | Show detected backend | Displays the detected OS ID/version/codename, native package manager, repository family, and whether automatic repository application is supported. |
| `8` | List supported package types | Prints package/repository types discovered from the YAML data file. |
| `9` | Doctor / data validation | Validates runtime commands, Python availability, distro/backend detection, YAML data, DNS/mirror statistics, and the available privilege path (`root`, `sudo`, or `doas`). |
| `0` | Exit | Leaves the interactive menu. |

#### DNS submenu

| Key | Action |
| ---: | --- |
| `1` | Benchmark Iranian/local DNS resolvers. |
| `2` | Benchmark global DNS resolvers. |
| `3` | Benchmark all imported DNS entries. |
| `4` | Show the current DNS configuration. |
| `5` | Reset DNS changes managed by Mirava back to automatic/default behavior where supported. |
| `0` | Return to the main menu. |

DNS ranking requires stable replies and measures real query latency with `dig`. After a successful benchmark, the interactive flow can offer to apply the two fastest measured resolvers.

### Direct CLI options

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --menu` | Open the interactive menu explicitly. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --system-repo` | Detect and benchmark the current system repository family; on a TTY it can optionally apply the selected mirror. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --apply-system-repo --yes` | Detect, benchmark, and apply the fastest compatible system mirror non-interactively. The explicit `--yes` is required. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --check-all` | Check every registered mirror/package endpoint. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --fastest PACKAGE` | Benchmark mirrors for a package type such as `Ubuntu`, `Debian`, `PyPI`, or `npm`. Quote package names that contain spaces. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --fastest-ubuntu` | Shortcut for benchmarking Ubuntu mirrors. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --dns local` | Benchmark local DNS resolvers. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --dns global` | Benchmark global DNS resolvers. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --dns all` | Benchmark all DNS resolvers. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --current-dns` | Show the current DNS servers. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --system-info` | Show the server/network overview. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --backend-info` | Show distro/package-manager detection results. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --doctor` | Validate runtime dependencies, backend detection, and Mirava data. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --list-packages` | List package types known by `mirrors_list.yaml`. |
| `./check_mirrors.sh --help` | Show built-in help. |

Useful environment variables include `MIRAVA_MIRROR_FILE`, `MIRAVA_JOBS`, `MIRAVA_BENCH_RUNS`, `MIRAVA_OS_RELEASE_FILE`, `MIRAVA_PACKAGE_MANAGER`, and `MIRAVA_SKIP_NETINFO`.

## 🧪 What Mirava does now

Mirava uses `check_mirrors.sh` for execution and `mirrors_list.yaml` for repository and DNS data.

### Server and network overview

The interactive menu starts with the official project link first, followed by the FarshidSar repository:

- Official: `https://github.com/MiravaOrg/Mirava`
- FarshidSar: `https://github.com/farshidsar/Mirava`

Before the menu options, Mirava renders a short system table with only the useful at-a-glance fields: server name with RAM/uptime, operating system with architecture, public IP/location, current DNS servers, the active Linux package repository, and the Docker package repository. DNS/repository/Docker values are re-read from the current system configuration when the menu is drawn.

Public IP/location lookup uses short timeouts and does not block the tool when unavailable. Set `MIRAVA_SKIP_NETINFO=1` to disable the external public-IP/location lookup. The same overview can be printed directly with `./check_mirrors.sh --system-info`.

### Automatic dependency bootstrap

Run from a clone:

```bash
chmod +x check_mirrors.sh
./check_mirrors.sh
```

On supported Linux families, Mirava detects the native package manager and installs missing runtime requirements when possible:

- bootstrap: `bash`, `curl`, `ca-certificates`
- data parsing: Python 3, only when it is missing
- DNS benchmark: the package that provides `dig` (`dnsutils`, `bind-utils`, `bind`, or `bind-tools`, depending on the distribution)

Mirava does not require `yq` or PyYAML at runtime.

### Repository detection, validation, and ranking

Mirava can detect the current Linux family, find compatible repository candidates, validate real repository metadata, benchmark valid endpoints, and rank them by measured transfer speed and TTFB. Duplicate repository URLs are removed from the data and candidates are de-duplicated before benchmarking.

During repository, DNS, and full mirror checks, Mirava redraws a single adaptive progress row in interactive terminals instead of printing a new line for every spinner tick. The row shows checked/total, percentage, successful/failed checks, active workers and remaining items; on wide terminals it can also show the current endpoint. The progress line automatically shortens to the terminal width so it does not wrap. Redirected/CI output uses plain log-friendly progress lines.

| Family | Supported systems | Backend / behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| APT | Ubuntu, Debian | validates `Release`, backs up APT configuration, applies the selected mirror, refreshes indexes, and rolls back when validation/application fails |
| DNF/YUM | Fedora, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, CentOS/Stream | validates `repomd.xml`, adds the selected repository while keeping existing repositories as fallback |
| Pacman | Arch Linux, Manjaro | validates repository databases, prioritizes the selected server, and preserves fallback mirrors |
| APK | Alpine Linux | validates `APKINDEX.tar.gz`, backs up `/etc/apk/repositories`, applies the selected mirror, and rolls back on failure |
| Zypper | openSUSE Leap/Tumbleweed | validates `repomd.xml`, adds the selected repository with higher priority, and preserves existing repositories |

Known derivatives can still be benchmarked by repository family, but Mirava avoids automatic configuration rewrites when the exact distro layout is not known.

### DNS benchmark and management

Mirava contains local and global DNS candidates in `mirrors_list.yaml`. It measures real DNS query latency with `dig`, removes duplicate IPs, ranks responsive resolvers, and can optionally apply the fastest pair.

DNS application supports NetworkManager, `systemd-resolved`, `resolvconf/openresolv`, `dhcpcd`, and a backed-up `/etc/resolv.conf` fallback. Mirava can also display the current DNS configuration or reset Mirava-managed DNS changes.

### Safety

Before changing repository or DNS configuration, Mirava creates backups where applicable. Interactive system changes require confirmation, and non-interactive repository application requires the explicit `--yes` flag. Backups are stored under `/var/backups/mirava`.

### Interactive menu and CLI

Running `./check_mirrors.sh` in a terminal opens the menu. Available CLI operations include:

```bash
./check_mirrors.sh --system-repo
./check_mirrors.sh --apply-system-repo --yes
./check_mirrors.sh --check-all
./check_mirrors.sh --fastest Ubuntu
./check_mirrors.sh --fastest-ubuntu
./check_mirrors.sh --dns local
./check_mirrors.sh --dns global
./check_mirrors.sh --dns all
./check_mirrors.sh --current-dns
./check_mirrors.sh --system-info
./check_mirrors.sh --backend-info
./check_mirrors.sh --doctor
./check_mirrors.sh --list-packages
```

For a one-file download, save the script first and then run it so the bootstrap stage can restart itself with Bash if necessary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiravaOrg/Mirava/refs/heads/main/check_mirrors.sh -o check_mirrors.sh
chmod +x check_mirrors.sh
./check_mirrors.sh
```

The "fastest" result is specific to the current machine and network at test time and may change with routing, filtering, congestion, and mirror load.

## ✨ Changes in This Update

This update turns `check_mirrors.sh` from a basic mirror reachability checker into a portable cross-distribution repository and DNS optimizer while keeping mirror discovery and validation in one project.

- Added a portable POSIX launcher that can bootstrap `bash`, `curl`, and CA certificates with supported native package managers.
- Removed the runtime `yq`/PyYAML requirement; Mirava now uses its embedded data reader and installs Python 3 only when it is missing.
- Added Linux distribution and package-manager detection plus safe repository workflows for APT, DNF/YUM, Pacman, APK, and Zypper families.
- Added real repository metadata validation, parallel benchmarking, average transfer-speed/TTFB ranking, candidate de-duplication, and adaptive terminal progress.
- Added automatic backup/rollback safeguards for supported repository changes and backups under `/var/backups/mirava`.
- Added DNS benchmarking for local/global resolvers plus optional DNS apply/reset support through NetworkManager, `systemd-resolved`, `resolvconf/openresolv`, `dhcpcd`, or a guarded `/etc/resolv.conf` fallback.
- Added system/network overview, backend information, package listing, doctor/data validation, and non-interactive CLI modes.
- Added multilingual documentation in English, Persian, Arabic, Russian, and Simplified Chinese. English remains the primary README.
